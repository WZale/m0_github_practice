# GitHub Notes

To check your own understanding of GitHub, answer the questions that follow.

1. **What is the purpose of GitHub?** GitHub exists as a cloud-based app that interfaces with Git on your local machine. This makes it easier to collaborate, as well as having a backup of all your work in the cloud.

1. **What is the difference between forking and cloning a repository?** Forking a repo makes a new version of an existing repo, but puts it under your control so that you can make changes. However, a forked repo only exists on GitHub. When you clone a repo, you download it locally onto your machine so that you can make changes and push them back up as needed.
